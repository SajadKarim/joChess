# joChess

This is an academic project for N-Players Chess game. In the course Clean Code Development we are provided a 2-Players Chess game and we have to convert it to 3-Player Chess game (considering SOLID principles).

We preferred to make game even more generic and devised an architecture that converts it to N-Players game.

[More details shall be available soon...]

The base code used in this project is taken from the following location;
